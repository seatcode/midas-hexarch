## Introduction

A Frontend framework like [React](https://reactjs.org) is awesome, it brings in a modular approach to our UI logic while still providing relationships to understand how every piece relates each other.

But a complex business product needs more than UI logic. As the project grows, we may realize there's a growing amount of logic in no man's land.

Of course you can move that logic into separated files, but then you'll lack relationships and that's a problem you'll eventually suffer from.

This is [business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic), and some [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) exist to deal with it. Proven ways of organizing and relating all of its relevant pieces. [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) is one of those patterns.

## Usage from React

Let's start from what we know. Imagine you're building an online shop and you've got this fancy Cart component:

```tsx
function Cart({ items }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {items.map(item => <ProductCard item={item} />)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, we want to be able to remove a product from the cart. To do that, let's add a handler function as always:

```diff
function Cart({ items }) {
+ const handleRemove = async id => {
+   // TODO: Remove a product from the cart API
+ }

  return (
    <div>
-     {items.map(item => <ProductCard item={item} />)}
+     {items.map(item => (
+       <ProductCard item={item} onRemove={handleRemove} />
+     ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then, the function is ready to be filled with the API call, dealing with the response, transforming it, updating the local storage entry for the cache... OR, we can have all that done by the domain.

To use the domain, we have to import the hook and consume it:

```diff
+import { useDomain } from 'domain/react'

function Cart({ items }) {
+ const domain = useDomain()
```

And we're good to go:

```tsx
const handleRemove = async id => {
  // We first get the use case
  const removeItem = await domain.cart.RemoveItemUseCase.get()
  // Then we can execute it
  await removeItem.execute({ id })
}
```

You may be wondering why there's two steps to it. Why do I have to "get" the use case first? Why not just execute the use case as if it were a function? Well, the answer is [code splitting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting).

By doing this, the code from `RemoveItemUseCase` will not be downloaded until the remove button is clicked, which reduces the whole app bundle size. This has many performance benefits.

Now, let's take a closer look at the parts:

<p align="center"><image width="656" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4168389/161741685-2268ff49-8f0a-4119-951c-05fa5d9bf892.png" /></p>

So, after awaiting the promise that `get()` returns, we have the requested use case ready to use in a variable. No mystery here, all use cases have a single method called execute:

<p align="center"><image width="502" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4168389/161743734-2e1e6fc5-08e2-43f5-a613-b66b450f4674.png" /></p>

And that's it! Now we obviously would have to implement the RemoveItemUseCase so it does what it's supposed to do. But before we can go down that road we need to make some concepts clear.

## Getting inside

## Concepts

### Domain

The whole business logic is enclosed within the domain. The inner pieces of the domain can interact with each other, but can't interact with the outside.

From the outside perspective, the domain is a black box. The only thing you can see about the domain from React is:

- A list of use cases, which are essentially actions you can execute.
- The domain's config object.

### Config

- It's a plain object that can be read from any domain piece.
- It can also be read from the outside of the domain.
- It's aware of the environment.

### Context

A context is a business topic to group all its related logic. Any domain piece must be enclosed within a specific context.

For a given context, we can find:

- Models
  - Entities
  - Values
  - Responses
  - Adapters (for repositories)
- Repositories
- Mappers
- Services
- Use Cases (with public types)

### Models
  - They're private, meant to be consumed from the inside of the domain.
  - They're contracts to ensure a certain structure is enforced in specific domain pieces or data you create afterwards.
  - They're TypeScript types and abstract classes.
  - Cannot be used outside the domain.

### Types
  - They're public, meant to be consumed from the outside of the domain.
  - They're only written inside the use cases, to support dealing with use case execution results from the outside.
  - Cannot be used inside the domain.

## Dependency injection


## File structure

When doing Hexagonal Architecture we find a folder called `domain`. This is the place where all of the Hexagonal Architecture related logic lives:

```
domain
|- config/
|- @context/
|- types/
|- entry.ts
|- models.ts
|- react.ts
```

### Config directory

```
config
|- config.development.ts
|- config.production.ts
|- config.test-env.ts
|- config.ts
```

### @context directory

```
@context
|- useCases/
|- services/
|- mappers/
|- repositories/
|- models/
```

#### useCases

```
@context
|- useCases/
   |- GetSomethingUseCase
      |- index.ts
      |- factory.ts
```

#### services
#### mappers
#### repositories
#### models

### Types directory

```
types
|- @context.ts
```

### Root files

```
domain
|- ...
|- entry.ts âœ… <- You'll need to add every new use case in here
|- models.ts ðŸš«
|- react.ts ðŸš«
```

ðŸš« Be aware that you won't edit these, but here is what they do:

| File | Purpose |
|-|-|
| models.ts | Exports common models from which you'll extend your domain pieces. |
| react.ts | Exports hooks so you can use the domain from React. |
